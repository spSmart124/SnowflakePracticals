Below query provide a demonstration of using this function.

```SQL
ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST = 'All';

ALTER ACCOUNT SET CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST = 'mistral-large2,llama3.1-70b';

SELECT CORTEX_MODELS_ALLOWLIST;

CALL SNOWFLAKE.MODELS.CORTEX_BASE_MODELS_REFRESH();

SHOW MODELS IN SNOWFLAKE.MODELS;

---> use the mistral-7b model and Snowflake Cortex Complete to ask a question
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'MISTRAL-7B', 'What are three reasons that Snowflake is positioned to become the go-to data platform?');

---> now send the result to the Snowflake Cortex Summarize function
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mistral-7b', 'What are three reasons that Snowflake is positioned to become the go-to data platform?'));

---> run Snowflake Cortex Complete on multiple rows at once
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mistral-7b',
        CONCAT('Tell me why this food is tasty: ', menu_item_name)
) FROM FROSTBYTE_TASTY_BYTES.RAW_POS.MENU LIMIT 5;

---> check out what the table of prompts weâ€™re feeding to Complete (roughly) looks like
SELECT CONCAT('Tell me why this food is tasty: ', menu_item_name)
FROM TASTY_BYTES.RAW_POS.MENU LIMIT 5;

---> give Snowflake Cortex Complete a prompt with history
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mistral-7b', -- the model you want to use
    [
        {'role': 'system', 
        'content': 'Analyze this Snowflake review and determine the overall sentiment. Answer with just \"Positive\", \"Negative\", or \"Neutral\"' },
        {'role': 'user',
        'content': 'I love Snowflake because it is so simple to use.'}
    ], -- the array with the prompt history, and your new prompt
    {} -- An empty object of options (we're not specify additional options here)
) AS response;

---> give Snowflake Cortex Complete a prompt with a lengthier history
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE(
    'mistral-7b',
    [
        {'role': 'system', 
        'content': 'Analyze this Snowflake review and determine the overall sentiment. Answer with just \"Positive\", \"Negative\", or \"Neutral\"' },
        {'role': 'user',
        'content': 'I love Snowflake because it is so simple to use.'},
        {'role': 'assistant',
        'content': 'Positive. The review expresses a positive sentiment towards Snowflake, specifically mentioning that it is \"so simple to use.\'"'},
        {'role': 'user',
        'content': 'Based on other information you know about Snowflake, explain why the reviewer might feel they way they do.'}
    ], -- the array with the prompt history, and your new prompt
    {} -- An empty object of options (we're not specify additional options here)
) AS response;
